    <h2>History of LFC</h2>

        Liverpool F.C. was founded following a dispute between the Everton committee and John Houlding, club president and owner of the land at Anfield. 
        After eight years at the stadium, Everton relocated to Goodison Park in 1892 and Houlding founded Liverpool F.C. to play at Anfield.
        Originally named "Everton F.C. and Athletic Grounds Ltd" (Everton Athletic for short), the club became Liverpool F.C. in March 1892 and gained official recognition three months later, 
        after The Football Association refused to recognise the club as Everton.

    <p>Liverpool reached the finals of the Football League Cup and UEFA Europa League in Klopp's first season, finishing as runner-up in both competitions. 
        The club finished second in the 2018–19 season with 97 points (surpassing the 86 points gained during the 2008–09 season), losing only one game: a points record for a non-title winning side.
        Klopp took Liverpool to successive Champions League finals in 2018 and 2019, with the club defeating Tottenham Hotspur 2–0 to win the 2019 UEFA Champions League Final.
        Liverpool beat Flamengo of Brazil in the final 1–0 to win the FIFA Club World Cup for the first time.
        Liverpool then went on to win the 2019–20 Premier League, winning their first top-flight league title in thirty years.
        The club set multiple records in the season, including winning the league with seven games remaining making it the earliest any team has ever won the title,
        amassing a club record 99 points, and achieving a joint-record 32 wins in a top-flight season. In January 2024, Klopp announced that he would leave the club at the end of the season
